# Summary: Deploy Django Web App to Azure Kubernetes Service with Azure Pipelines

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide to deploying a Django web application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Azure Pipelines. The process involves containerizing the application with Docker, setting up Azure resources including a container registry and Kubernetes cluster, and configuring a pipeline in Azure DevOps for continuous integration and deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Azure DevOps account
- Azure subscription
- Basic knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes, and Azure DevOps

## Steps

### 1. Setup Azure Resources
- Create a resource group using Azure CLI.
- Create a container registry using Azure CLI.
- Create a Kubernetes cluster using Azure CLI.

### 2. Build Docker Image
- Write a Dockerfile to package the Django web application.
- Use the Docker CLI to build the Docker image.
- Push the Docker image to the Azure Container Registry.

### 3. Configure Azure Pipeline
- Connect your GitHub repository to Azure DevOps.
- Create a new pipeline and select "Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service" template.
- Configure pipeline settings such as subscription, Kubernetes cluster, and container registry.
- Validate and configure the pipeline.

### 4. Deployment
- The pipeline consists of build and deployment stages.
- Build stage builds the Docker image and pushes it to the Azure Container Registry.
- Deployment stage deploys the application to the Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes manifest files.

### 5. Accessing the Application
- Access the deployed application through the external IP address of the Kubernetes service.
- Alternatively, access the application through the Azure portal by navigating to Kubernetes resources > Services and Ingresses.

## Conclusion
Deploying Django applications to Azure Kubernetes Service with Azure Pipelines enables automated CI/CD workflows, streamlining the development and deployment process. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can efficiently deploy your Django web applications to AKS and leverage the scalability and reliability of Kubernetes.
